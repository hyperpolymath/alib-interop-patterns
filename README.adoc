A cookbook of safe interop and boundary patterns for typed-to-JS ecosystems (ReScript, Melange), including optional runtime validation.

toc::[]

== Status
Alpha.

== Purpose
Provide reviewed patterns for:

* default args and external bindings
* boundary decoding/encoding (JSON, dynamic objects)
* error handling across JS exceptions
* “safe wrapper first” conventions

This is documentation-first, implementation-second.

== Relationship to Proven
Where runtime validation helps, patterns may demonstrate use of Proven.
ReScript bindings exist as `@hyperpolymath/proven-rescript`. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

== Relationship to Melange + npm packaging reality
Interop patterns should acknowledge practical build integration constraints in JS ecosystems, including how “stdlib artifacts” are packaged and consumed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
