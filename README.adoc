A cookbook of safe interop and boundary patterns for the ReScript ecosystem (ReScript, Melange), with optional runtime validation.

toc::[]

== Status
Alpha.

== Purpose
Documentation-first patterns for:

* external bindings (defaults, optionals, polymorphism)
* untyped data boundaries (JSON/dynamic objects)
* exception boundaries (JS errors)
* “safe wrapper first” conventions

This repo reduces pressure on compiler work by giving developers safe, reviewable patterns today.

== Relationship to Proven
Where runtime validation helps, patterns may demonstrate optional Proven entrypoints.
No Proven dependency is required for using most patterns.

== License
