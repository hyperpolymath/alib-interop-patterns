A cookbook of safe interop and boundary patterns for the ReScript ecosystem (ReScript, Melange), with optional runtime validation.

toc::[]

== Status
Alpha.

== Purpose
Documentation-first patterns for:

* external bindings (defaults, optionals, polymorphism)
* untyped data boundaries (JSON/dynamic objects)
* exception boundaries (JS errors)
* “safe wrapper first” conventions

== Relationship to Proven
Where runtime validation helps, patterns may demonstrate optional Proven entrypoints.
Most patterns should be usable without a Proven dependency.

== Relationship to aLib repos
* `aggregate-library` demonstrates the method under stress.
* `alib-for-rescript` applies it as an ecosystem proving ground.
* This repo documents safe boundary patterns regardless of whether you adopt aLib.
